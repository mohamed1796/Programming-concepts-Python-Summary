### **Chapter 1: Introduction to Computers and Programming**

1. **Basic Definitions:**
   - **Computer**: A programmable machine that follows instructions from a program.
   - **Program**: A set of instructions for the computer to perform tasks (also known as software).
   - **Programmer**: A person who designs, writes, and tests programs.

2. **Computer System Components:**
   - **Hardware**: The physical parts of a computer (e.g., CPU, memory, storage, input/output devices).
     - **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: The brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions.
       - **Control Unit**: Manages and decodes instructions.
       - **Arithmetic & Logic Unit (ALU)**: Performs mathematical and logical operations.
   - **Memory**:
     - **Main Memory (RAM)**: Temporarily stores data and programs while in use; volatile.
     - **Secondary Storage**: Non-volatile storage (e.g., hard drives, USBs).
   - **Input Devices**: Allow data to enter the system (e.g., keyboard, mouse).
   - **Output Devices**: Present data from the system (e.g., monitor, printer).

3. **Software Types:**
   - **System Software**: Manages the hardware and basic functions (e.g., operating systems).
   - **Application Software**: Programs that perform specific tasks (e.g., word processing, web browsers).

4. **Programming Concepts:**
   - **Low-level Languages**: Close to machine code, harder to write (e.g., assembly language).
   - **High-level Languages**: Easier to write and understand, closer to human language (e.g., Python, C++).
   - **Compiler**: Translates high-level code into machine language.
   - **Interpreter**: Executes high-level code line by line (e.g., Python interpreter).

5. **Programming Basics:**
   - **Statements**: Instructions for actions (e.g., assignment, print).
   - **Keywords**: Reserved words in programming (e.g., `if`, `else`).
   - **Variables**: Named memory locations to store data.
   - **Operators**: Symbols for operations (e.g., +, -, =).

6. **Problem Solving and Algorithms:**
   - **Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.
   - **Control Structures**: Sequence, decision, and repetition control the flow of a program.

7. **Flowcharts and Python:**
   - **Flowcharts**: Graphical representations of algorithms.
   - **Python**: A popular high-level programming language with two execution modes:
     - **Interactive Mode**: Execute single commands.
     - **Script Mode**: Execute entire programs saved as scripts.

### **Chapter 2: Input, Processing, and Output**

1. **Designing a Program**:
   - Programs follow a **development cycle**:
     1. **Design** the program.
     2. **Write** the code.
     3. Correct **syntax errors**.
     4. **Test** the program.
     5. Correct **logic errors**.

2. **Basic Program Flow**:
   - **Input**: Data received by the program.
   - **Processing**: Operations performed on input data (e.g., calculations).
   - **Output**: Data displayed to the user after processing.

3. **Python Print Function**:
   - The `print()` function displays output.
   - Multiple items can be printed using a comma (`,`).
   - Control output format with arguments like `end=' '` (to change end-of-line behavior) and `sep='-'` (to change separators between items).

4. **Escape Sequences & String Concatenation**:
   - Special characters can be used in strings:
     - `\n`: New line.
     - `\t`: Horizontal tab.
   - **String concatenation**: Combining strings using the `+` operator.

5. **Formatted Output with F-strings**:
   - F-strings (formatted strings) allow embedding expressions and variables:
     - Example: `print(f'Hello {name}')`.
     - Formatting options (e.g., rounding numbers): `print(f'{num:.2f}')` for two decimal places.

6. **Identifiers and Variables**:
   - **Identifiers**: Names for variables, functions, etc. Should be meaningful and follow rules:
     - Must start with a letter or underscore.
     - Cannot use keywords.
   - **Variables**: Store data in memory; values can change during program execution.
     - Assignment format: `variable = value`.

7. **Input from Keyboard**:
   - Use `input()` function to get data from the user.
   - Converts data into strings by default. For numeric input, use type conversion functions like `int()` or `float()`.

8. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - Basic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//` (integer division), `%` (modulus), `**` (exponent).
   - Follow the **order of operations** (parentheses, exponents, multiplication/division, addition/subtraction).

9. **Named Constants**:
   - Constants are variables whose values donâ€™t change. While Python doesnâ€™t have built-in constants, you can indicate a constant by using all uppercase letters (e.g., `TAX_RATE = 0.075`).

10. **Comments**:
    - Comments are used to explain code and are ignored by the interpreter. Begin with `#`.
    - Good practice: Add comments at the start of a program and throughout complex sections.

### **Chapter 3: Decision Structures and Boolean Logic**


### **1. Relational Operators**
- **Relational operators** compare two values and return `True` or `False`.
  - Examples: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`.
  - These expressions allow you to check conditions like "is greater than" or "is equal to."

### **2. The `if` Statement**
- **`if` statement**: Controls the execution of statements based on a condition. If the condition is `True`, the statements inside the `if` block are executed.
  - Example: 
    ```python
    if score >= 60:
        print("Passed")
    ```

### **3. The `if-else` Statement**
- **`if-else` statement**: Provides two possible paths of execution. If the condition is `True`, one block is executed; if `False`, the other block is executed.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if score >= 60:
        print("Passed")
    else:
        print("Failed")
    ```

### **4. Nested `if` Statements**
- **Nested `if`**: An `if` statement inside another `if` statement. It allows for more complex decision-making by testing multiple conditions.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if account_type == 'premium':
        if balance > 1000:
            print("Eligible for loan")
    ```

### **5. The `if-elif-else` Statement**
- **`if-elif-else`**: Tests multiple conditions in sequence until one is `True`. Once a `True` condition is found, the corresponding block is executed, and the rest are skipped.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if score >= 90:
        print("Grade A")
    elif score >= 80:
        print("Grade B")
    else:
        print("Grade C")
    ```

### **6. Logical Operators**
- **Logical operators** (`and`, `or`, `not`) are used to combine relational expressions into compound Boolean expressions.
  - **`and`**: Both conditions must be `True` for the overall expression to be `True`.
  - **`or`**: At least one condition must be `True` for the overall expression to be `True`.
  - **`not`**: Reverses the Boolean value of an expression.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if age > 18 and age < 65:
        print("Eligible for work")
    ```

### **7. Checking Numeric Ranges**
- You can check if a number falls within a certain range using relational and logical operators:
  - Example:
    ```python
    if 0 <= grade <= 100:
        print("Valid grade")
    ```

### **8. Boolean Variables**
- **Boolean variables** store `True` or `False` values and are often used as flags in programs to track conditions.
  - Example:
    ```python
    flag = False
    if temperature > 30:
        flag = True
    ```
